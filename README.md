# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the skills I have learned
thus far in The Odin Project. My goal is to show that I know how to properly
create directories, sub-directories, files, and folders. I will be generating 
a basic recipe that should demonstrate the following skills:

- index.html created
- img file created
- upload image
- create an additional relative link on the page to future recipes
- properly head the html file
- have elements within the recipe that need to be emphasized and/or bolded
