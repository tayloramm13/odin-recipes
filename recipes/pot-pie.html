    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375-degrees F. Gather & prep all ingredients according to the Ingredients List, above.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook chicken:</strong> Add 2 T butter to a 12-inch oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breasts with salt/pepper. Place chicken in the skillet to brown for ~2-3 min/side. Transfer the skillet to the oven for the chicken to roast for 15-20 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, shred chen into bite-sized pieces using a fork.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook aromatics:</strong> Place skillet back over medium heat and add the remaining 2 T of butter. Once melted, add in: onion, carrots, celery, and potato. Season with salt/pepper. Stir to combine. Cook for 5-7 min, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are softened and slightly browned. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Make sauce:</strong> Sprinkle flour over softened veggies and stir to combine. While scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon, slowly pour in the chicken stock. It will bubble vigorously, almost cooking all the way down very quickly. <em>Be sure to scrape up any brown bit that may have formed at the bottom of the skillet - that's where the flavor is!</em> While stirring constantly, slowly pour in milk. Once combined, add: rosemary, thyme, sage. Bring to a simmer and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly. Add salt/pepper to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish pot pie:</strong> Stir the shredded chicken and frozen peas into the pot pie filling. Arrange the flaky biscuits over top. In a small bowl, mix melted butter with the chopped herbs and garlic. Brush this buttery goodness mixture over the biscuits. Finish with a sprinkle of salt, if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake pot pie:</strong> Carefully transfer your heavy, full skillet to the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the biscuits are golden & cooked through. Carefully remove from the oven and cool slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve!</strong> Removing any spent herb stems from the skillet, portion the chicken pot pie into individual bowls. Serve and enjoy:)</li>
