    <h2>Wild Mushroom Beef Stew - A perfect winter meal for the family!</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I am now coming up on my second ever <em>true</em> winter here, in
      Colorado, and I am determined to make some necessary changes to make this
      winter more...comfortable. That starts with new and improved comfort food
      recipes. The key to these recipes is creating a dish that is hearty, warm,
      full of amazing flavor, and preferably wouldn't make a bad leftover dish.
      The first meal that comes to my mind that is all of things and enough to
      warm even your house up...is a beef stew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I should also be honest and mention that...I am just now eating meat
      again after <strong> 8 years</strong> of being predominantly plant based.
      Cooking meat is new too me, the flavors however, are not. One of my
      favorite meals that my mother made for our family was beef stew. We were
      using a crockpot, but the flavors were <strong>UNMATCHED</strong>. So my
      goal is to recreate that perfection of a winter meal for my own family,
      and I think I may have the perfect recipe for just that!
    </p>
    <p>
      This easy to follow 10 step recipe will be the perfect solution to those
      cold winter nights.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs chuck (cut into bite sized cubes)</li>
      <li>1 large onion (chopped)</li>
      <li>1 lb variety of mushrooms (rough chop)</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>6 sprigs of time</li>
      <li>1 cup Cognac</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>~ 1 qt beef stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chuck into medium bite sized cubes. Season with salt/pepper. Preheat a dutch oven or a thick bottomed pot with vegetable oil until it starts smoking.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.</li>
        <li>Place beef into pot, make sure not to overcrowd the pan. Allow to brown on all sides</li>
        <li>In the meantime, wash and roughly chop your mushrooms</li>
        <li>Check on the meat and remove once it's nice and brown. Set aside. You will have some fat and bits on the bottom of the pot. You will use this to add flavor to your dish later.</li>
        <li>Add in onions, garlic, thyme, bay leaf, and mushrooms and toss to cover with the fat in the pot. Saut√©e for about 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the meat into the pot and sprinkle everything with 1 tablespoon of flour to thicken. Mix to combine well.</li>
        <li>Take ~1 cup Cognac and pour into the pot. <strong>NEVER POUR STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOTTLE</strong>. You can let this cook out or light the cognac on fire with a <strong>long match</strong>, or if the pot is shallow enough, tilt it towards the flame so it will catch on fire. This technique is also known as <em>deglazing</em>.</li>
        <li>The alcohol should cook out after about 3 minutes. Then pour enough beef stock to cover the meat and mushrooms almost all the way. Adjust seasoning and cover with tightly fitting lid. Place into the over for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to 275-degrees and allow to cook for another 90 minutes or until meat is nice and tender!</li>
    </ol>
